# üîß EUPFR Basic Configuration With ELS Vehicle Packs

Are you french speaker ? You can read this description in french here.

## üìù Description

EUP offers a basic configuration with vehicle packs. Unfortunately, these packs are not compatible with ELS. I chose vehicle packs that are compatible with ELS, reproducing as many of those offered by EUP as possible.

These configuration files are currently being created. You can contribute to the project by visiting [its GiHub repository](https://github.com/SebastienCozeDev/EUPFR-Basic-Configuration-With-ELS-Packs).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Install the requirements. You will find installation instructions for these requirements by following the links.
2. Download this configuration.
3. Copy the files in your `Grand Theft Auto V\lspdfr\data` folder.

Other agencies currently don't have vehicle packs and are using vanilla vehicles. I will add more packs as I go.
